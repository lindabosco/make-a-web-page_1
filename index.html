    <h2>Lesson 1: The internet, the web, browsers and HTML</h2>   
      
       <div class="concepts">
       <p>
       The <b>internet</b> is a way that allows computers (phones, tablets, servers etc) 
       around the world to talk to one another. 
       We send these information packets (bytes) through LAN cables or through WiFi.
       It used to be just text. </p>
       <p>
       Now computers talk using a new language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
       to create a web page.
       So instead of just text, HTML allows the webpage to be in a graphical format.
       We will need a <b>browsers</b> to view HTML in a graphical format, which you 
       will know it as a webpage.
       All these web pages is collectively known as the <b>world wide web</b> or 
       commonly known as the web.</p>
       <p>
       So the internet is the physical highway between computers, the vehicles on 
       the highway are the packets of information.
       There are many different types of vehicles now. The car is like the web traffic, 
       the trucks like the email traffic and the motorcycles like your music, video, 
       picture traffic. So the internet contains the the web, email, music, video, pictures etc.

       <b>HTML terms</b>
       </p>
       
       <p>
        HTML stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language. </i>
        HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. 
       </p>
       </div>
   
       <div class="concepts">
       <p>
       <b>Tags and Elements</b>
       </p>
       <p>
       HTML documents are made of HTML elements. 
       When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
       </p>

       <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
       </p>
       
       <p>
       Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. 
       Every tag has to be correct for the computer to understand what you want it to do.
       </p>
       </div>
   
   
       <div class="concepts">
       <p>
       <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
       </p>
       <p>
       HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. 
       Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside 
       of them.
       </p>
       </div>
    
    
      <div class='concepts'>
      <p>
      <b>So how does everthing work together?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      When you enter the url for a webpage like www.google.com, 
      your computer sends a <i>HTTP Request to a server</i> using HTML.
      The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to your computer.
      Your <i>web browser</i> on your computer will interpret the HTML into the webpage 
      that you ultimately see on your computer screen.

   <h2>Lesson 2: Understanding and creating structured document with HTML</h2>
    
    
     <div class="concepts">
     <p>
     <b>Understanding structured document with HTML</b>
     </p>  
     <p>
     <p>
     The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements 
     inside of them. 
     This relationship is like a family tree. 
     My mother has multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
     In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. 
     There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... kind of like Russian dolls!
     Another way to look at this is like a folder system on the computer. 
     There are files within folders and folders within folders and so on...
     </p>
     </div>
   
   
     <div class="concepts">
       <p>
       <b>Creating structured documents in HTML (indentations) </b>
       </p>     
       <p>
       When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. 
       The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
       When you are looking at the code, the further right the text, the more deeply it is nested.

       <b>Important to avoid repetitions</b>
       </p>    
       <p>
        The aim of reducing repetition of information is to make it easier to maintain large codes and problem-solving will be easier too.

      <h2>Lesson 3: What is CSS?</h2>
      
      <div class="concepts">
       <p>
       Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet lanaguage use for
       describing the look and formating of a document written in a 
       markup language.
       <p>  
       <p>
       CSS separates the document 
       content (text) from the document presentation. And then gives you control over elements such as 
       the layout, colors, and fonts etc. 
       You achieve this by allowing multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying 
       the relevant CSS in a separate .css file. This reduces
       complexity and repetition in the structural content.

       <div class="concepts">
       <p>
       <b>Inheritance</b>
       </p>
       <p>
       It means that the property will inherit the properties from its parent element.
       </p>

       <div class="concepts">
       <p><b>Selector</b>
       </p>
       <p>
       A selector says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules 
       I'm about to tell you to this part of the markup."
       A .prefix is a class selector. Eg please select .border and make the necessary changes.
